================================

"commen" block:
This block stored commen config for tpcontrol.
`username` and `password` were the username and password to your tp router.
`stand_flow_up` and `stand_flow_down` were used to control flow while up
means the bottom of the net flow and down means top of the net flow. Note its
uint was KB per second(KB/s).

That's it.
